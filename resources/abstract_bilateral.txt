We study the interaction between private and official sovereign debts. We develop a quantitative sovereign default model augmented by a large senior creditor with whom borrowing terms are negotiated. We use this model to evaluate concerns surrounding the emergence of new official lenders not bound by the Paris Club. The dynamics of the bilateral surplus lead the government to choose higher sovereign risk, ultimately creating welfare losses. This relational overborrowing effect arises due to an endogenous cross-elasticity of bilateral terms to market debt, which can be tested in practice to evaluate new forms of bilateral sovereign debt.
