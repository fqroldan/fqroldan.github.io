We study the interaction between private and official sovereign debt. The emergence of new official lenders not bound by the Paris Club institutional framework has raised concerns about the seniority structure and terms of sovereign debt and their welfare implications. We evaluate this view in a quantitative sovereign debt and default model augmented by the presence of a large senior creditor with whom borrowing terms are negotiated. We find that the dynamics of the bilateral surplus endogenously lead the government to overborrow in markets and expose itself more intensely to sovereign risk, creating welfare losses. Our model also implies a simple test to assess whether a particular form of bilateral sovereign debt is likely to create welfare gains or losses.
