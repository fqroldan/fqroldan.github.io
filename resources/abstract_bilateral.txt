We study the interaction between private and official sovereign debts. The emergence of new official lenders not bound by the Paris Club institutional framework has raised concerns about their implications for the terms and seniority structure of sovereign debt. We evaluate this view in a quantitative sovereign default model augmented by the presence of a large senior creditor with whom borrowing terms are negotiated. The dynamics of the bilateral surplus endogenously lead the government to overborrow in markets and expose itself more intensely to sovereign risk, creating welfare losses. The model also implies a simple test to assess the welfare implications of new forms of bilateral sovereign debt.
