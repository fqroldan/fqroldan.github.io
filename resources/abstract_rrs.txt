We study the interaction of risk-sensitive preferences with sovereign default risk. Macro-financial separation, a pervasive property of real business cycles models, breaks in the context of sovereign debt. Risk aversion that is consistent with observed risk premia significantly affects the equilibrium, particularly the distribution of debt and spreads, as well as inference drawn about costs of default. We (re)evaluate the welfare effects of access to capital markets, debt dilution, and post-default negotiations. We also find that convex default costs can become problematic when paired with meaningful risk aversion and show how to amend them in a way that is also more consistent with observation.
