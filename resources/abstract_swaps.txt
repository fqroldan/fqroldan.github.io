We study the use, terms, and desirability of central bank swap lines for sovereign borrowing. We find that swaps, a type of bilateral debt, interact strongly with borrowing terms on international capital markets. The high frequency at which swaps can be renegotiated makes their interest rate reflect outside options and market power. We highlight how swaps create an overborrowing incentive similar to debt dilution. This happens through a weakening the threat of autarky which typically sustains sovereign borrowing but also dynamically through the incentives created by the bilateral relationship. Our model is consistent with the prevailing pattern of sovereign borrowing primarily occurring through bond markets, with swap lines serving as a ``first line of defense'' when debt repayment becomes difficult. Moreover, we identify significant welfare effects associated with having access to swaps.
