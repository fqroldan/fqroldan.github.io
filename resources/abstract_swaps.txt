We study the use, terms, and desirability of Central Bank swap lines for sovereign borrowing. We find that this type of bilateral debt strongly interacts with borrowing terms on international capital markets. The high frequency at with the swap can be renegotiated makes its interest rate reflect outside options and bargaining power. We highlight how bilateral debt worsens debt dilution problems and overborrowing, in particular through muting the threat of autarky which sustains sovereign borrowing. Our model is consistent with usage of swap lines as first line of defense when repaying the debt becomes difficult, relatively small volumes, and large welfare effects.
