We study the use, terms, and desirability of Central Bank swap lines for sovereign borrowing. We find that this type of bilateral debt strongly interacts with the more familiar form in international capital markets. The possibility for ex-post bilateral renegotiation curtails default along the equilibrium path, but makes interest rates reflect outside options and bargaining power. Our model explains both the seniority of drawn swap lines with respect to private sovereign debt and the relatively small volumes contracted.
