We study the use, terms, and desirability of Central Bank swap lines for sovereign borrowing. We find that this type of bilateral debt strongly interacts with the more familiar form in international capital markets. The possibility for ex-post bilateral renegotiation curtails default of privately contracted debt along the equilibrium path, but makes interest rates reflect outside options and bargaining power. We highlight how bilateral debt worsens overborrowing and debt dilution problems, in particular through increasing the value of autarky which sustains sovereign borrowing. Our model therefore explains the relatively small bilateral volumes contracted.
