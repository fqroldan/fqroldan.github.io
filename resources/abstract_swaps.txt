We study the use, terms, and desirability of central bank swap lines for sovereign borrowing. We find that swaps, a type of bilateral debt, strongly interact with borrowing terms on international capital markets. The high frequency at which swaps can be renegotiated makes their interest rate reflect outside options and bargaining power. We highlight how swaps worsens debt dilution problems and overborrowing, in particular through weakening the threat of autarky which sustains sovereign borrowing. Our model is consistent with most borrowing taking place through bond markets and features the usage of swap lines as a ``first line of defense'' when debt repayment becomes difficult. We find large welfare effects of having access to swaps.
