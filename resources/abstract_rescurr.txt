Why do countries which issue debt in local currency accumulate foreign-exchange reserves more than foreign-currency issuers? This fact can be puzzling considering that international reserves are held as insurance against shocks which create recessions at home and increase sovereign spreads. Local currency debt is a two-sided blade: it dampens this risk by enabling lower payments in recessions when the exchange rate depreciates but, at the same time, opens the door for ex-post inefficient policies which affect the exchange rate in order to reduce payments. Holding FX reserves serves as a commitment device not to manipulate the exchange rate in this way when repaying the debt proves difficult.
