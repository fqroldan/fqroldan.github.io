We investigate the effect of uncertainty about the nature of output costs of sovereign default on debt tolerance. While the theoretical literature assumes output losses lasting until market access is restored, it is less clear from the empirical evidence whether output eventually recovers its pre-default trend. We include such uncertainty in a model of sovereign default and find that it can significantly boost debt sustained in equilibrium. We also consider a government which is averse to this type of uncertainty and seeks robust decision rules. We calibrate the model to match evidence on the output trajectory around default episodes and find output costs of default of about the size found in the empirical literature, alongside significant uncertainty about their permanence and a strong desire for robustness.
